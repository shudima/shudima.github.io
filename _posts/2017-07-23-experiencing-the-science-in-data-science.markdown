I have been in the software industry for a long time. I did various roles but most of the time I was a developer or more formally, I was a “Software Engineer.”
Today, I’m a Data Scientist. While my job is not entirely different, I’m still sitting in front of a computer and writing code, there nature of work is different. Not long after the beginning of my Data Science journey, I started to experience moments of frustration. It’s not that I didn’t like my job, it’s was just that once in a while I was frustrated because of the project I worked on at the time. Most of the times, those moments were a result of me thinking that I know what I doing and realizing that I’m not. Today I have realized that these moments are just the differences between Engineering and Science.
