I started my way in the Data Science world a few years back. I was a Software Engineer back then and I started to learn online first (before starting my Master’s degree). I remember that as I searched for online resources I saw only names of learning algorithms — Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Networks and so on. It was very hard to understand where I should start. Today I know that the most important thing to learn to become a Data Scientist is the pipeline, i.e, the process of getting and processing data, understanding the data, building the model, evaluating the results (both of the model and the data processing phase) and deployment. So as a TL;DR for this post: Learn Logistic Regression first to become familiar with the pipeline and not being overwhelmed with fancy algorithms.

So here’s my 5 reasons why today I think that we should start with Logistic Regression first to become a Data Scientist. This is only my opinion of course, for other people it might be easier to do things in a different way.
